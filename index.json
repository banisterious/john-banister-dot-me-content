As far as I know, these tapes hadn't been played much over the years, and while reviewing them, my main interest was in a conversation that my cousin Dave recorded in the spring of 1987 during a visit with his uncle and my grandfather, Ellis Banister.\nAs it happens, I also came across an old acetate disc at around the same time that these tapes came into my possession. On it, Ellis and his younger sister, Junelle, played piano and sang together, with Ellis doing most of the singing and Junelle accompaniment. Unfortunately, the disc has no liner notes and there's no information about the circumstances around its creation or when it was made; my guess would be the 1930s or 40s. Considering the medium‚Äîacetate is notoriously fragile compared to vinyl‚Äîand how long ago it was recorded, the quality of the recordings is pretty remarkable, something for which I'm very grateful.\nAs was the case with his siblings, Ellis was a talented musician. One of the more memorable themes that I recall from my own childhood with my grandfather was the enthusiasm with which he sit down at a piano and play and sing; he never passed up an opportunity perform for others, and his strong, tenor voice has stayed with me to this day.\nAlthough a few of his brothers also served in the US military, Ellis spent more time in the service than they did, and in fact devoted most of his life the Army, a career which began in 1939 when at the age of 20 he joined the National Guard (as a means to help pay for college). Ellis was 22 when he and the rest of the newly minted 45th Infantry Division‚Äînicknamed the Thunderbird Division‚Äîwere called up for active duty in 1941. Beginning with their 1943 landing at Sicily, Ellis served with the 45th for the remainder of the European Theater and earned the rank of First Lieutenant by April 1945. By the time he retired from the Army in 1961 he had earned the rank of Major, a title that was used frequently and affectionately whenever members of his family and community addressed or spoke about him. After retiring, he taught elementary school for ten years, and passed away in 1988 at the age of 69, less than a year after this interview was conducted.\nWhat Ellis saw and experienced during his time in Europe affected him deeply and profoundly, but it is worth highlighting that there are moments when, in this interview, this stands out strongly. Whether it's in the form of a passing comment (‚ÄúYou know, you have little things that are tragic, like the burning of those buildings, which I have regretted to this day. But it had to be done.‚Äù) or just a brief pause between beats in his telling, it‚Äôs clear that even at this late point in Ellis‚Äô life the experiences weighed just as heavily on him as ever; the memories were every bit as complex and present for him as they had been when he originally experienced them.\n","date":"January 27, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/the-world-is-waiting/","section":"","summary":"","title":"The World is Waiting for the Sunrise","type":"posts"},{"content":"\nTwo summers ago I set out to fully document the contents of an old family cassette tape collection from the 1980s. While taking a deeper dive into my great Uncle Bryan Banister's tapes one evening, all of a sudden I heard the sounds of singing and piano accompaniment. Surprised by the unexpected discovery, I played the tape several more times, and then went through the other six tapes recorded by Bryan.\nThe practice of recording and sending tape messages between members of my grandfather's generation (usually consisting of informal and intimate one-way conversations) was quite popular in the 1980s. And while these particular tapes of Bryan's were recorded in the 1980s, the music that he was sharing on them was actually from the 1970s‚Äîhe was simply capturing the the output of his old reel-to-reel tape recorder on his more modern cassette tape recorder.\nThe music in question dated from a few occasions when Bryan and his sister, Junelle (both in their early 50s at the time) visited with one another. Being very musically oriented, as were all of my grandfather's siblings, performing songs and hymns together during such visits was apparently quite common. It allowed them to bond in a way that evoked fond memories of doing the same while growing up.\nLast spring I submitted a one-hour arrangement drawing from this collection to a syndicated program called Framework Radio. Bryan introduces at the beginning and wraps up at the end, but the bulk of it is just the sibling duo singing, playing piano, and bonding.\nAt the very end, Bryan says, \"...you might stow this away in the archives, and somewhere along the way your children, or grandchildren, or whatever, might enjoy listening to this.\" I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.\n","date":"December 2, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/the-world-will-sing/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Till the World Will Sing Again","type":"posts"},{"content":"Portland Bound Coastal Starlight Train Amtrak Journey (September 19, 2024) Northbound Amtrak Coastal Starlight train from Oakland (starting at 2:45 AM Pacific time) with stops in Martinez and Milpitas.
